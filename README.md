# flutter_redux_boilerplate

A Flutter application boilerplate, with Redux included.

## Motivation

Coming from a React Native background, using Redux in dart feels rather awkward. This project's purpose is to provide a well-structured starter project, with an architeture that resembles Redux.js'.

This boilerplate includes:

* [redux.dart](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/redux)
* [flutter_redux.dart](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_redux)
* [redux_thunk.dart](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/redux_thunk)
* [redux_logging.dart](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/redux_logging)
* [redux_persist.dart](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/redux_persist) & [redux_persist_flutter.dart](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/redux_persist_flutter) to preserve the auth state between app executions
* Bottom tab navigation!
